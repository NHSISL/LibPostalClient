# Introduction
The NHSISL.LibPostalClient is a Standard compliant wrapper for Libpostal (https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) which parses and normalizes addresses. It is designed to take unstructured address data, such as a mailing address written in natural language, and convert it into a structured format that can be more easily processed by software systems.

# Key Features
## Address Parsing: 
Libpostal can break down an address into its constituent components, such as street names, cities, states, postal codes, and more. This makes it easier to work with and compare address data.

## Address Normalization: 
It can normalize addresses to a consistent format, reducing variations and inconsistencies that may exist in address data.
